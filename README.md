# SMS Spam Mail Detection Model

## Overview
SMS Spam mail Detection is a machine learning model that takes an SMS as input and predicts whether the message is a spam or not spam message. The model is built using Python and deployed on the web using Streamlit.

## Technology Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Streamlit

## Features
- Data collection
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Model building and selection
- Web deployment using Streamlit
- Cyber Security


### Model Building and Selection
Multiple classifier models were tried, including NaiveBayes, random forest, KNN, decision tree, logistic regression, ExtraTreesClassifier, and SVC. The best classifier was chosen based on precision, with a precision of 100% achieved.

### Web Deployment
The model was deployed on the web using Streamlit. The user interface has a simple input box where the user can input a message, and the model will predict whether it is spam or not spam.
